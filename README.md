# Simply-Mylife

Simply Mylife is proposed as a shared and interactive android based calendar application. 
The problems to be considered while developing this application are: android program 
building platform and programming languages to be used, database management system 
required to store the user data, interface design with respect to accessibility to provide 
seamless user experience and the software development methodologies to be used during 
the building of the application. Additionally, the application might require the use of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning as an additional feature to be added in the later stages as 
an update.
Proposed solution
The solutions to the above discussed problems were researched for and found in the 
literature review. I researched the existing literature on applications similar to my proposed 
application and analysed the gap in the market. I analysed three existing applications and 
their interface. As a resulting solution, I will design an interactive interface with group chats 
and polling options for shared calendar events, different colour banners for a variety of 
calendar tasks, and a separate tab for daily planner activities. The application will have three 
tabs in total, for work/study calendar, personal events calendar and a planner, all of which 
are shareable with other users of the application. The interface will cater to all, inclusive of 
any disability with its accessibility options like 'colour invert' and quick assistance with a
'help' button. Personalisations options will be available to add images to any event from the 
user's gallery.
The application will be developed using android studio, as upon research, it was found best 
suited and beginner-friendly. The graphics will be designed within the platform. The 
application will be coded using java and SQLite will be used for creating the database and 
firebase will be incorporated to store the user database on the cloud and for sharing multiple 
user databases to synchronise calendar events. Artificial intelligence and machine learning 
will be added on later stages to provide personalised recommendations to the users on the 
basis of their planner activities and events, and to find common time slots for event creation 
in shared calendars.
The user needs to create an account to use these advanced functionalities, but without 
signing up the application can be used as a basic calendar with the personalisation features. 
The application development process will be agile development, dividing the task into sprint 
cycles of short terms (as seen in the Gantt chart further down).
